Welcome to the our API documentation.

Rate Limiting
-------------

Unauthenticated calls are permitted 150 requests per hour. If your application is being rate-limited by
the REST API it will receive a HTTP `403` response code.

JSONP
-----

JSONP or "JSON with padding" is a complement to the base JSON data format. You can add 'padding' by 
including the request parameter `callback`. The returned `Content-Type` will be `application/javascript`. For example:

```
http://api.theysay.io/v1/sentiment?text=...&callback=processSentiment
```
